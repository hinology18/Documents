# web-application-with-security-vulnerabilities

Project 3 task: web application with security vulnerabilities for aspiring cyber professionals. Containing some vulnerabilities from the OWASP top 10

Some that I included are:

A05: Security Misconfiguration - No validation, no password rules, weak or no authentication mechanisms.

A07: Identification and Authentication Failures - No login logic or checks; no password strength enforcement; no session control.

A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures - No logging of user actions or failed attempts.

A02: Cryptographic Failures - Passwords entered as plain text, no hashing or hiding.



I attempted to focus on the ones I had a clearer idea of doing such as A09 and A07
It took me the period of thursday and friday to complete this
